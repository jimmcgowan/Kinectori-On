Kinectori-On
============

A Kinect Based Matrix Style Music Sequencer, inspired by Yamaha's Tenori-On.  The shape and position of the player's body is mapped onto a grid of lights.  A set of sounds or instrument samples can be loaded into each row in the grid, and each column represents a musical beat in a bar.  As the metronome cycles through each beat, any lights that are turned on in that beat's column trigger the playback of the sound associated with the light's row.

The project was written in C# using the Microsoft Kinect For Windows SDK, and the FMOD Ex API for sound playback.
